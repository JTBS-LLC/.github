# JTBS LLC

https://jtbsllc.com

JTBS builds practical software, infrastructure, and automation systems designed to solve real operational problems. Our projects range from developer utilities and internal platforms to tools that help teams move work forward without unnecessary complexity or AI cost dependency. 

## Open Source

We are in the process of converting a number of previously closed-source internal tools into open source projects.

Some repositories will appear gradually as they are cleaned up and prepared for public oss release.
